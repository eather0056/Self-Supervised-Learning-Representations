# Self-Supervised Learning Representations

This repository contains the implementation of various self-supervised learning techniques for generating representations across different modalities, including word embeddings, sentence embeddings using BERT, image embeddings using DINO, and speech embeddings using HuBERT. This project was carried out as part of the coursework at the University of Toulon under the guidance of Santiago.

## Introduction

Self-supervised learning has gained significant importance in recent years for generating powerful representations across various domains. This repository showcases implementations and experiments with self-supervised techniques for word, sentence, image, and speech embeddings.

## Dependencies

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.0
- PyTorch
- Transformers (for BERT)
- DINO (for image embeddings)
- HuBERT (for speech embeddings)

You can install Python dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eather0056/Self-Supervised-Learning-Representations.git
cd Self-Supervised-Learning-Representations
```

## Word Embeddings

For word embeddings, we use [describe the method you implemented here]. To generate word embeddings, follow the steps in the [Word Embeddings](./word_embeddings/README.md) section.

## Sentence Embeddings (BERT)

We leverage BERT for sentence embeddings. Detailed instructions for generating sentence embeddings can be found in the [Sentence Embeddings (BERT)](./sentence_embeddings/README.md) section.

## Image Embeddings (DINO)

Our image embeddings are based on DINO. To generate image embeddings, refer to the [Image Embeddings (DINO)](./image_embeddings/README.md) section for instructions.

## Speech Embeddings (HuBERT)

For speech embeddings, we employ HuBERT. To generate speech embeddings, please check the [Speech Embeddings (HuBERT)](./speech_embeddings/README.md) section for guidance.
